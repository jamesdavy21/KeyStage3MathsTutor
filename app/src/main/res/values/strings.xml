    <string name="what_are_equations">An equation is formed when two expressions are said to be equal.\n
        Typically, equations contain unknown values which are often represented by letters such as ‘X’ and ‘Y’.\n\n
        When solving equations, the goal is to find the actual values of ‘X’ and ‘Y’.\n
        Example: I think of a number (X), multiply by 3, and add 2 with an answer of 17.\n
        When written as an algebraic equation:\n
        3X + 2 = 17\n
        To find the solution you must collect like? Terms together\n
        3X + 2 – 2 = 17 – 2\n
        3X = 15\n
        3X ÷ 3 = 15 ÷ 3\n
        X = 5</string>
    <string name="equation_questions">8X = 16,2X + 4 = 12,3X - 9 = X + 3</string>
    <string name="equation_answers">X = 2,X = 4,X = 6</string>
